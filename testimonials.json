The best part is that she's now so much more focused on me during walks, and she doesn't react to other dogs anymore! The 'coming back' command was a game changer for us – exactly what I needed for Cara. 10/10, I highly recommend Mattias! He really knows his stuff and makes training fun for both dogs and their owners!",

    "text": "I can’t recommend Mattias enough. I contacted him because our mini schnauzer Daphne is extremely nervous and can often come across aggressive. He trained us to advocate for her more, create the environment that’s best for her when we bring her to the office and to draw her attention to back to us when out in the park or engaging with other dogs and distractions. One of the biggest successes we’ve had so far with her is on the lead, something we never thought achievable. She walks along side us now and doesn’t pull like before. In short, she’s a calmer, more responsive dog even now around Halloween, the toughest time of the year for her!! All in all, training with Mattias turned out to be a great success and a wonderful investment.",

Walking Bodie now is very enjoyable compared to him dragging me down the street. I highly recommend Mattias and will use him again to make sure myself and Bodie are making the most of our time together. It has been life changing! Thank you Mattias.",
